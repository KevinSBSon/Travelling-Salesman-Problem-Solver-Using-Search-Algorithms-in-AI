# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Solver-Using-Search-Algorithms-in-AI
The Traveling Salesman Problem, deals with creating the efficient path that a salesman would take while traveling between cities. The solution to any given TSP would be the shortest way to visit a finite number of cities, visiting each city only once, and then returning to the starting point. For the most part, the solving of a TSP is no longer executed for the intention its name indicates. Instead, it is a foundation for studying general methods that are applied to a wide range of optimization problems. We are going to find a solution by using two algorithms, Branch and Bound Depth First Search Algorithm and Stochastic Local Search Algorithm and take an experiment to evaluate the result in the view of performance, accuracy, and efficiency with an appropriate measure factor.
